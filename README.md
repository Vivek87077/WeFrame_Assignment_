# 🚀 WeframeTech Dashboard — Assignment Scaffold  

A minimal scaffold for the **WeframeTech Dashboard Assignment**, designed to help you quickly set up, customize, and build a pixel-perfect UI.  
This project provides the base layout and structure, with flexibility to integrate `shadcn/ui` primitives and additional components as per requirements.

## 🛠️ Setup & Integration
This scaffold comes with the basic layout. To add the full set of shadcn/ui components:

After initialization, you can generate specific components (e.g., Button, Card, Input) by running:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card input
```


## 🎯 Assignment Notes
The design requires pixel-perfect implementation.
Ensure responsive layout for desktop and mobile views.
Use shadcn/ui primitives for consistency in styling and accessibility.
Add your own polish: animations, hover effects, or custom components.

👉 This README is styled with **clear sections, emojis for readability, code blocks, and professional flow**.  

Do you want me to also add a **“Tech Stack” section** (React, Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI) so it looks even more complete for GitHub?
